#### What is CRUD? Give a brief overview of how you can create a CRUD API

#### Explain the same-origin policy and how it relates to CORS.

#### What is destructuring? Can you give me an example of destructuring an array and an object? How do I destructure a function parameters?

#### What is an ES6 template literal? What problem do they solve? Can you give an example of a template literal in use?

#### How do you calculate the "length" of an object (i.e. the number of keys)

#### What will be the output of this code?

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
```

**Follow-up:** How can we fix this to output `1, 2, 3, 4 ...`

#### Write a function `duplicate` that takes an array and returns a new array containing each element twice.

Example:

```js
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4]); // [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
```

**Bonus**: return an array where the amount of each element in the returned array is its index in the original

Example:

```js
duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4]); // [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]
```

#### Can you describe the main difference between a `.forEach` loop and a `.map` loop and why you would pick one versus the other?

#### Explain event bubbling
